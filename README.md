Employee Directory Website Using Django
</br>
<p>I designed and developed an Employee Directory Website using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS. The website features a user-friendly home page displaying an employee table with columns for S.no, full name, designation, and mobile number. Users can click on an employee's full name to access a detailed 'employee_details' page. This page showcases a card in the center containing the employee's picture, full name, email, and mobile number, enhancing the user experience. A convenient 'Back To Home' button on the 'employee_details' page allows users to navigate back to the home page seamlessly. Additionally, I implemented an administrative superuser account to manage website content efficiently.</p>
